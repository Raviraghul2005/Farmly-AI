## 💡 Opening Line

"Meet Ramesh, a farmer from rural Maharashtra. Last year, he lost 30% of his tomato crop because he couldn't identify blight disease early enough. He's not alone—over 85% of Indian farmers lack access to timely agricultural expertise, and language barriers prevent them from using existing apps. That's why we built Farmly AI. Let me show you."

---

## 🎤 Closing Line

"Farmly AI isn't just an app—it's an AI-powered safety net for the farmers who feed our nation. In our pilot, we achieved 18% yield increase and ₹8,500 extra income per farmer. Our vision: reach 5 million farmers by 2027. Thank you. [Pause] I'm happy to answer any questions, and please scan this QR code to try the app yourself."

## ⚡ If Something Fails

**Stay calm**. Smile. Say:

"This is exactly why we built offline mode..." [Switch to backup]

OR

"Let me show you our backup video while the network reconnects..."

OR

"In production, this typically responds in under 2 seconds. Let me show you a pre-captured result..."

**Never apologize profusely**. Handle failures like a pro—it shows resilience.
